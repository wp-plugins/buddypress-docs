=== BuddyPress Wiki Component ===
Contributors: Aekeron
Tags: buddypress, wiki, education, collaboration, group
Requires at least: WordPress 3.0.1, BuddyPress 1.2.5.2
Tested up to: WordPress 3.0.2 / BuddyPress 1.2.6
Stable tag: 1.0.0

This plugin provides site and group based wiki functionality for a Buddypress installation.

== Description ==

NEW IN 1.0.0

* Wiki article comments now supported via the activity stream.
* Fixed the html list styling errors (thanks to those that contributed fixes - credits in css file)

Optional: Install the bp-fadmin plugin to enable group administrators to move wiki pages between groups and have quick access to change the view/edit/etc settings of the wiki pages in all their groups.  http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bp-fadmin/

This is a completely new version of the BuddyPress Group Wikis plugin.  

The plugin is now based on the BuddyPress Skeleton Component and has been rewritten from the ground up to take advantage of internationalisation support, BuddyPress standards for ajax, function hooks and several months of BuddyPress/wordpress experience (as compared to very little before writing the original group wiki plugin).

Key features as compared to the original plugin:

* No multi-blog functionality required (utilises WP3.x's "custom post types" methods).
* Support for custom templating of pages.
* i18n support.
* Built in such a way to allow easy extension to support site-wide wikis and namespaces.
* Uses proper BuddyPress/Wordpress post submit and ajax methods.
* User controllable wiki page deletion.
* Group wiki data cleaned up properly on group deletion.
* Better text diff methods.

DEVELOPMENT VERSION - NOT ALL FUNCTIONALITY AVAILABLE YET
